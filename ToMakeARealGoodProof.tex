\begin{intro}
_{Bb} _{F/A} _{Ab} _{Eb} _{Ebm} _{Bb} _{C7} _{Eb/F} _{Bb}
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{Bb} When your theory's falling ^{F/A}on its face \\
^{Ab} And you can't tie up that ^{Eb}one last case \\
^{Ebm}Just remember there's no ^{Bb}need to race \\
^{C7} To make a ^{Eb/F}real good ^{Bb}proof \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{} When you check it over and the ^{}doubts appear \\
^{} And there is no-one there to ^{}calm your fears \\
^{} You might think you need a ^{}million years \\
^{} To make a ^{}real good ^{}proof \\
\end{verse}

\begin{bridge}
^{Eb} I know you haven't tried ^{Bb/F}induction yet \\
^{Gbaug} And contra^{Eb/G}diction's going ^{Bb}wrong \\
^{Eb} You need to build your logic ^{Bb}step by step \\
^{C7}Making sure that each line follows ^{F}on \\
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
^{} You could use the letters ^{}$p$ and $q$ \\
^{} And if that don't work try ^{}$w$ \\
^{} There ain't nothing that you ^{}wouldn't do \\
^{} To make a ^{}real good ^{}proof \\
\end{verse}

\begin{bridge}
^{} You can draw a picture ^{}here or there \\
^{} To make your ^{}thoughts easy to ^{}see \\
^{} You can end it with a ^{}little square \\
It's ^{}much faster than writing Q.E.^{}D. \\
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
^{}It'll make you happy if your ^{}theorem's true \\
^{} Might even win a Fields ^{}medal too \\
^{} So do whatever you have ^{}got to do \\
^{} To make a ^{}real good ^{}proof \\
\end{verse}

^{C7} To make a ^{Eb/F}real good ^{Bb}proof \\
