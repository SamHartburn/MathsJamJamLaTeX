\begin{song}{title=Sorting A Stack of Pancakes,key=G, lyrics=Sam Hartburn, subtitle=Banana Pancakes by Jack Johnson}

\begin{intro}
^{Am7} ^{G7} Well can't you see that they're not ^{Am7}sorted? \\
We need to order them by ^{G7}size \\
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
But ^{D}baby, you ^{G}hardly even ^{D}notice, ^{Am7}when I try to ^{C7}show you these \\
^{G}Cakes aren't being ^{D}stacked in the ^{Am7}order they're supp^{C7}osed to \\
There's ^{G}small ones in the ^{D}middle and ^{Am7}big ones at the ^{C7}top \\
I'm ^{G}sorting a stack of ^{D}pancakes, I ^{Am7}wonder if I'll ^{C7}ever ^{Am7}stop \\
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Feels like it's taking all my ^{G7}time \\
Can't you see that they're not ^{Am7}sorted \\
We need to order them by ^{G7}size \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
But just ^{}maybe I'll ^{}find an algo^{}rithm, ^{}get into the ^{}rhythm \\
^{}Put in a load of ^{}practice `cause it ^{}takes some repe^{}tition \\
I'll ^{}flip the biggest ^{}pancake with ^{}all the ones on ^{}top \\
Then ^{}turn the whole stack ^{}over, I ^{}know that method's ^{}gonna ^{}work \\
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
But it's not the best that there could ^{}be, no \\
For a stack that has $n$ ^{}pancakes \\
The flips are $2n$ minus ^{}$3$ \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
Not the best it could ^{Am7}be, mmm mmm mmm ^{G7}mmm \\
That $2n$ minus ^{Am7}$3$, it's not the best that it could ^{G7}be \\

`Cause some ^{Am7}folk they did some work and I will tell you what it was that they ^{D}found \\
Eighteen $n$ over el^{Am7}even \\
That's the number that's the currently best-known upper ^{D}bound, `s not so easy \\
If you ^{Bm}want an answer for your pile of cakes \\
If you ^{Em}really want to ^{Em/D}know how many ^{C}flips it'll take \\
They don't ^{G}know, oh ^{D}no, they don't ^{G}know \\
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
But ^{}baby, you ^{}hardly even ^{}notice, ^{}when I try to ^{}show you these \\
^{}Cakes aren't being ^{}stacked in the ^{}order they're supp^{}osed to \\
There's ^{}small ones in the ^{}middle and ^{}big ones at the ^{}top \\

\begin{chorus}
Feels like it's taking all my ^{}time \\
Can't you see that they're not ^{}sorted \\
We need to order them by ^{}size \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{outro}
I give up, I'm ^{Am7}hungry \\
They're not sorted and I ^{G7}really, really, really don't mind \\
`Cause you see, `cause you ^{Am7}see, they're gonna taste just ^{G7}fine \\
\end{outro}
