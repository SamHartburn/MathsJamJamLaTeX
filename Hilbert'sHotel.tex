\begin{verse}
Well, ^{E}since my baby left me, \\
I've ^{E}found a new place to dwell, \\
It's ^{E}down at the start of infinity street \\
at ^{E7} Hilbert's Hotel. \\
^{A7} There are so many \\
^{A7} There are so many \\
^{B7} So many rooms to occu^{E}py \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Well, an^{}other guy came to join us \\
To ^{}cry away his gloom \\
We ^{}moved from $n$ to $n$ plus one \\
To ^{}give this guy a room \\
^{} There are so many \\
^{} There are so many \\
^{} So many rooms to occu^{}py \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
An ^{}infinite busload of passengers \\
^{}Sought a place to stay \\
We ^{}moved from $n$ to $2n$ \\
And we ^{}fit them in that way \\
^{} There are so many \\
^{} There are so many \\
^{} So many rooms to occu^{}py \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
An ^{}infinite number of buses \\
Came ^{}looking for some space \\
With the ^{}help of triangle numbers \\
We found ^{}everyone a place \\
^{} There are so many \\
^{} There are so many \\
^{} So many rooms to occu^{}py \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Hey now, ^{}if your baby leaves you, \\
And you ^{}got a tale to tell. \\
It's ^{}always full, but there's always room \\
At ^{} Hilbert's Hotel \\
^{} There are so many \\
^{} There are so many \\
^{} So many rooms to occupy \\
