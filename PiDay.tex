\begin{verse}
^{D}I don't care a^{G}bout root 2, ^{D}e and phi, they're ^{A}not in Q \\
^{Bm}gamma, I don't ^{G}have a clue, it's ^{D}Pi Day, I'm in a ^{A}huff \\

^{D}I don't want to ^{G}spend my March ^{D}making tasty ^{A}pastry tarts \\
^{Bm}They look like a ^{G}dreadful chart, it's ^{D}Pi Day, I'm in a ^{A}huff \\
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{G}Tauists: ^{A}wait \\
^{Bm}I'd rather self-^{G}immolate \\
Than ^{D}have a pi v ^{A}tau debate \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^Lately I have ^seen a spate of ^people who can't ^write the date \\
^ISO 8-6-^0-1's great, it's ^Pi Day, I'm in a ^huff \\

^You say you have ^found beauty ^in Euler's i^dentity \\
It's ^basic trigon^ometry, it's ^Pi Day, I'm in a ^huff \\
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^It's ok, ^mate \\
^If you want to ^celebrate \\
^But I'll geek out on ^{}\textbf{every} date \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
^{Bm} You've got some Raspberry ^{G}Pis \\
You want to exer^{D}cise \\
Computing ^{A}digits (in hex) of ^{Bm}pi \\
You're shouting from the ^{G}roof \\
You've got a lovely ^{D}proof \\
Due to Bai^{A}ley, Borwein and ^{Bm}Plouffe \\
Their work is great it's ^{G}true,  \\
But I'd prefer if ^{D}you \\
Found some^{A}thing useful to ^{Bm}do \\
Forgive me acting ^{G}gruff \\
I've just had en^{D}ough \\
It's Pi Day, ^{A}I'm in a huff \\
